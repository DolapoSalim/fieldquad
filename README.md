## ‚ú® Key Features

### üñºÔ∏è Image Upload
- Upload images of fieldwork quadrants from your local computer.

- Automatically extract the **coordinates** of all annotations:
  - **Original coordinates** (in pixel values relative to image dimensions)
  - **Normalized coordinates** (scaled between 0 and 1)

### üìä Percentage Coverage Estimation
- Calculate the **percentage area covered** by each annotated class.
- Useful for ecological assessments, species distribution, and biodiversity monitoring.

### üíæ Export Options
- Download results in multiple formats:
  - **TXT** ‚Äî For raw coordinate and class data.
  - **JSON** ‚Äî Structured annotation and coverage data for programmatic use.
  - **XLSX** ‚Äî Easy-to-read spreadsheet format for reporting and analysis.
