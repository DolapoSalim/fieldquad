## ✨ Key Features

### 🖼️ Image Upload
- Upload images of fieldwork quadrants from your local computer.

### 🛠️ Annotation Tools
- Use various annotation tools to mark and classify objects:
  - **Bounding Box**
  - **Polygon**
  - **Freehand Drawing**
- Assign a class number to each annotation for accurate classification.

### 📍 Coordinate Extraction
- Automatically extract the **coordinates** of all annotations:
  - **Original coordinates** (in pixel values relative to image dimensions)
  - **Normalized coordinates** (scaled between 0 and 1)

### 📊 Percentage Coverage Estimation
- Calculate the **percentage area covered** by each annotated class.
- Useful for ecological assessments, species distribution, and biodiversity monitoring.

### 💾 Export Options
- Download results in multiple formats:
  - **TXT** — For raw coordinate and class data.
  - **JSON** — Structured annotation and coverage data for programmatic use.
  - **XLSX** — Easy-to-read spreadsheet format for reporting and analysis.
